## Alarm system for fire detection and extinguishing

BME 680 air quality sensor detects air quality measurements and based on the values fire can be detected. Then audible signal is triggered and a fire hydrant opens. 
Sensor data is periodically recorded on the blockchain, thus facilitating the investigation of the causes of the accident.
