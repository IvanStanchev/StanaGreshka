## Alarm system for fire detection and extinguishing

The system uses BME 680 air quality sensor to make air quality measurements and based on their values fire can be detected. Then audible signal is triggered and a fire hydrant opens. The system also calls you and sends you an SMS in order to notify you that there is fire. The data measured by the sensor is periodically recorded on the blockchain, thus facilitating the investigation of the causes of the accident.
